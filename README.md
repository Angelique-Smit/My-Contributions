# My-Contributions
A list of repositories I have contributed to, such as group projects:

**My current group project: Pocket Tolk**
https://github.com/JahuanFortes/TLE2

**My contribution:** 
I made the styling for this webapp. It can be found under the following branch:
https://github.com/JahuanFortes/TLE2/tree/2-34-ik-wil-dat-de-applicatie-er-duidelijk-uitziet-met-een-leesbare-ui

**TLE1: Ip-Car**
https://github.com/faroeq33/TLE1

**My contribution:**
I set up the project in Laravel along with the login system Laravel provides. I also made the first version of the CRUD system we used. Since the branch has since been merged I am unable to link to a specific branch.

**CLE3: Webservice for physically limited individuals**
https://github.com/Anny-Xi/CLE_3

**My contributions:**
I made the webservice under the sport-centre directory (I reuploaded the code recently). The directory can be found right here:
